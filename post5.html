                            class="text-justify" style="color: rgb(0,0,0);"><br>With worldwide numbers of COVID-19 cases in decline since April, there has been more focus on life after the pandemic. Many researchers are interested in figuring out the long-term effects of a SARS-CoV-2 infection.<br><br>A
                            new study, which appears in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/373/bmj.n1098"><em>BMJ</em>Trusted</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/373/bmj.n1098">Source</a>, examined the elevated risk of developing a new
                            health condition following a SARS-CoV-2 infection.<br><br><strong>COVID-19background</strong><br><br>Since the World Health Organization (WHO) declared that COVID-19 cases constituted a pandemic more than 1 year ago, just over
                            164 million people have contracted the underlying virus, and&nbsp;<a href="https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/">3.4</a><br><a href="https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/">million people</a>&nbsp;have died as a result.<br><br>Many with the
                            infection are&nbsp;<a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/40-45-who-contract-new-coronavirus-are-asymptomatic">asymptomatic</a>, but others have symptoms that can range from mild to<br>severe. The virus has overwhelmed
                            the healthcare systems of some countries, with hospital intensive care units filled beyond capacity due to the number of severely ill COVID-19 patients.<br><br>The symptoms of COVID-19 may clear up within a matter of weeks,
                            but they can last much longer. Doctors sometimes refer to this issue as “<a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/long-covid">long COVID</a>” and the people who experience it as “long haulers.”<br><br><br><br>The
                            new retrospective study examined people who had tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 between January 1 and October 31, 2020. From 266,586 people with SARS-CoV-2 infections, the researchers examined the records of 193,113 participants
                            who were diagnosed with COVID-19 and followed for at least 21 days.<br><br>The participants were aged 18–65, and according to the paper, each was part of a “large United States health plan.” To track the participants, the researchers
                            took information from a national claims database, a laboratory testin database, and an inpatient hospital admissions database.<br><br>The researchers checked the participants’ records to see how many had been diagnosed with
                            a new medical condition within 6 months of the “post-acute phase,” which they defined as a period beginning 3 weeks after the initial COVID-19 diagnosis.<br><br>After compiling this data, the study authors compared it with
                            data from other groups who had been admitted to the hospital, including a group with a continuous healthcare plan in 2020 who did not have diagnosed COVID-19.<br><br>The researchers found that 14% of participants with COVID-19
                            had developed at least one new medical condition that required treatment following the acute phase of their SARS-CoV-2 infection.<br><br>A new health condition that occurs as a consequence of a previous illness is called a
                            “sequela.” The authors write:<br><br>“An increased risk of specific clinical sequelae after the acute infection was noted across a range of organ systems, including cardiovascular, neurologic, kidney, respiratory, and mental
                            health<br>complications.”<br><br>The risk of developing a new condition was 5% higher among this group, compared with the control group who did not have diagnosed COVID-19.<br><br>The increased likelihood of experiencing a
                            new medical condition following a SARS-CoV-2 infection was not limited to older people or people with preexisting conditions. Many younger people, including those with no previous history of health issues, developed a new condition
                            after having COVID-19.<br><br><strong>“Healthcare professionals should be alert to the possibility of&nbsp;long COVID in anyone with confirmed or suspected COVID-19. How to treat these&nbsp;longer-term consequences is now an urgent research priority,” Dr. Elaine&nbsp;Maxwell, a scientific advisor at the National Institute for Health Research, in&nbsp;London, wrote in an associated&nbsp;</strong>

While the
                                most obvious result of doing so is a reduction in deaths and hospital admittances, it is also important to consider the longer-term effects on healthcare systems throughout the world.<br><br><strong>“The greater risk for incident sequelae after the acute phase of&nbsp;SARS-CoV-2 infection is relevant for healthcare planning,” the study authors&nbsp;highlight.</strong><br><br>In
                                an interview with&nbsp;<em>Medical News Today</em>, Dr. William Schaffner, a professor of medicine in the Division of Infectious Diseases at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, in Nashville, TN, shared his thoughts on
                                the new study.<br><br>“This is a solid study that provides an estimate of how frequently such new symptoms occur: 14%,” Dr. Schaffner said. “This is a very high proportion of patients. There was a wide spectrum of symptoms
                                involving numerous organ systems. The impact on the healthcare system of these many patients requiring medical care over a long period of time will be substantial.”<br><br><strong>Potential&nbsp;limitations</strong><br><br>The
                                researchers acknowledge that their study had some flaws. They were not able to include the risk of death, for example, due to the limitations of their databases.<br><br>Also, they note that they may have misclassified some
                                participants. For example, while participants in the control group had no diagnosis of COVID-19, the illness may have been undiagnosed in some people, which has the potential to skew the data.<br><br></p>
