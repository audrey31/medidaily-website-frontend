However, scientists from the University of Texas (UT) Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas have discovered glaring disparities between
                            areas with high and low mortalities.<br><br>The team&nbsp;<a href="https://newsroom.heart.org/news/u-s-cvd-death-rate-drops-overall-county-level-data-signals-ongoing-regional-disparities?preview=42e4">presented</a>&nbsp;their

                            May 20, 2021.<br><br>Uncovering the trends<br><br>The researchers reviewed data gathered between 1980 and 2014 from all 3,133 U.S. counties. CVD-related deaths included all deaths attributed to cardiovascular causes on the
                            death certificates.<br><br>They targeted county-level data because that is where many decision-makers devise public health policies.<br><br>Using a&nbsp;<a href="https://journal.r-project.org/archive/2018/RJ-2018-048/RJ-2018-048.pdf">ClustMixType algorithm</a>&nbsp;approach
                            yielded three distinct clusters of counties based on the CVD-mortality trajectories over the study’s timeline.<br><br>“High mortality” counties had a baseline of approximately 60 CVD deaths per 10,000 population. “Intermediate
                            mortality” and “low mortality” clusters had a baseline of 50 and 40 CVD deaths per 10,000 population, respectively.<br><br>The researchers compared these statistics with county-level demographic, environmental, and health markers.
                            These data included crime rates, housing vacancies, smoking, diabetes, obesity, and food scarcity.<br><br>The analysis revealed parallel declines in CVD deaths among all groups.<br><br>However,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.utsouthwestern.edu/education/medical-school/departments/internal-medicine/divisions/cardiology/fellowships/current-fellows.html">Dr. Shreya Rao</a>,
                            the study’s lead author and research fellow at the UT Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas, recounted:<br><br><strong>“We were surprised to find that even though CVD death rates&nbsp;improved across the country, including in areas where rates had been among the&nbsp;highest and the lowest, relative differences across county groups and existing&nbsp;disparities among counties did not change. Counties that started with the</strong><br><strong>highest rates of death continued to perform worse than other counties, and&nbsp;those with the lowest rates of death stayed the lowest during the study&nbsp;period.”</strong><br><br><strong>Areas&nbsp;of great concern</strong><br><br>The
                            regions with the lowest CVD mortality included counties in the Northwest, Great Plains, Midwest, Northeast, and Florida.<br><br><strong>Areas in the South Atlantic states, Deep South, and portions of&nbsp;Appalachia saw the highest mortality rates.</strong><br><br>Dr.
                            Rao notes: “High-mortality counties were much more clustered and centered in areas known to have high rates of chronic health conditions, such as heart disease, stroke, high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes, and obesity.”<br><br><strong>The&nbsp;tell-tale signs</strong><br><br>The
                            study found that the highest-mortality counties had higher nonwhite populations. These areas also saw low high school completion rates, higher violent crime, and higher housing vacancies.<br><br>It concluded that education
                            status, violent crime rates, and smoking were the strongest predictors of being in the high-mortality subgroup.<br><br>The UT researchers note that public health agencies do not normally consider social issues as controllable
                            risk factors for CVD. Nonetheless, the study’s authors believe that these problems impact long-term health outcomes.<br><br><strong>Indisputable&nbsp;link</strong><br><br>Dr. Rao observed an “inextricable” correlation between
                            social and economic distress and poor health metrics.<br><br>The study’s senior author,&nbsp;<a href="https://utswmed.org/doctors/ambarish-pandey/">Dr. Ambarish Pandey</a>, an assistant professor of internal medicine at UT
                            Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas, commented:<br><br>“For clinicians, it is very natural to focus on the modifiable risk factors for our patients… [H]owever, it is important to understand that some of an individual’s risk
                            factors are not necessarily under their<br>control. And some factors may be modifiable through public policy and health systems changes and programs.”<br><br><br><br><br></p>
