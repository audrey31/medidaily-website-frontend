The study notes that the presentation

                                activities themselves were diverse. For example, 17 studies involved singing or playing existing music, 10 dealt with musical improvisation, and six documented movement, dance, or both.<br><br>Similarly, the studies employed
                                different tools for assessing cognition, mood, quality of<br>life, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/323454">anxiety</a>.<br><br><em>Medical News Today</em>&nbsp;asked Dorris whether the analysis
                                was able to identify a difference in the benefit people received from different forms of active participation.<br><br><strong>Dorris said, “Based on this research, what we were able to find&nbsp;is that active music making, no matter the type, is helpful for general&nbsp;thinking and memory.”</strong><br><br>“It
                                will be exciting,” Dorris added, “to see future research continue to use the classification system to understand if there are specific cognitive benefits to activities like singing versus playing an instrument and how those
                                benefits may support people with dementia.”<br><br><strong>What&nbsp;the researchers found</strong><br><br>To assess the effect of music on cognitive functioning in the new study, the researchers focused on nine studies
                                involving 495 participants. They found that active participation in music produced a small yet significant positive effect on cognitive function.<br><br><strong>In terms of the impact music had on emotional well-being, the&nbsp;results were a bit more ambiguous.</strong><br><br>Four
                                of the six studies examining it found a positive effect. While the effect ranged in size among these studies, overall, the study reports, the benefit was not greater than that of physical exercise, although certainly the
