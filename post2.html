                        <p>May is National Cancer Research Month, a time to highlight the ongoing work of scientists who dedicate their lives to understanding and treating cancer. Here, we cover 10 myths associated with cancer to help people cut through
                            the maze of misinformation.<br></p>
                        <p class="text-justify" style="color: rgb(0,0,0);"><br>According to the World Health Organization (WHO), cancer accounted for&nbsp;<a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/cancer">10 millionTrusted Source</a>&nbsp;deaths worldwide in 2020. Globally, it is a leading
                            cause of death.<br><br>In the United States, an estimated&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/understanding/statistics">39.5%</a>&nbsp;of people will receive a cancer diagnosis within their lifetime.<br><br>Myths
                            tend to develop around particularly prevalent conditions. It is no surprise, therefore, that people often misunderstand cancer.<br><br>“Cancer” is a generic term for a group of diseases that can affect any part of the body.
                            This variety adds fuel to the fire of confusion.<br><br>In this article, we hope to dispel some myths and clarify this common and varied group of diseases.<br><br><strong>1. Cancer is a death sentence</strong><br><br>Cancer
                            is not a death sentence. Despite the sobering statistics quoted above, cancer is not always terminal.<br><br>As scientists understand cancer better and develop improved treatments, recovery rates continue to improve.<br><br>For
                            instance, in January 2019, an estimated&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/understanding/statistics">16.9 million</a>&nbsp;cancer survivors were living in the United States. In the United Kingdom, survival rates
                            have&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/health-professional/cancer-statistics/survival#heading-Zero">doubled</a>&nbsp;in the last 40 years.<br><br>It is also worth noting that survival rates vary significantly depending
                            on the type of cancer. For instance, in the U.K., survival rates for testicular cancer are&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/health-professional/cancer-statistics/survival#heading-One">98%</a>, whereas survival
                            rates for pancreatic cancer are just 1%.<br><br>According to the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/myths">National Cancer Institute</a>:<br><br>“In the United States, the likelihood of
                            dying from cancer has dropped steadily since the 1990s. Now, 5-year survival rates for some cancers, such as breast, prostate, and thyroid cancers, are 90% or better.<br>The 5-year survival rate for all cancers combined is
                            currently about 67%.”<br><br>Overall, cancer death rates are slowly declining, although the survival rates of some cancers are increasing more than others. An annual report on the status of cancer in the U.S., which appears
                            in&nbsp;<a href="https://acsjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cncr.32802"><em>Cancer</em></a>&nbsp;in 2020, concludes:<br><br>“[C]ancer death rates decreased 1.5% on average per year during 2001 through 2017.”<br><br><strong>2. Cancer is&nbsp;contagious</strong><br><br>This
                            is a myth. Cancer is not contagious. Someone with cancer cannot spread it to others.<br><br>However, some sexually transmitted diseases,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/cancer/hpv/basic_info/index.htm">including</a>&nbsp;
                            <a
                                href="https://www.cdc.gov/cancer/hpv/basic_info/index.htm">human papillomavirus (HPV)Trusted Source</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/causes-of-cancer/infections-eg-hpv-and-cancer/does-hepatitis-cause-cancer">hepatitis B and C</a>, can cause cancers
                                in the cervix and the liver. In these cases, an infectious agent causes the cancer, but the cancer itself is not contagious.<br><br>As an interesting aside, scientists have&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3228048/">documentedTrusted</a>&nbsp;
                                <a
                                    href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3228048/">Source</a>&nbsp;that cancers in some animals, including Tasmanian devils and dogs, can cause fatal transmissible cancers: devil facial tumor disease and canine transmissible venereal tumor, respectively.<br><br><strong>3. Cell phones cause cancer</strong><br><br>To
                                    date, there is no evidence that cell phones cause cancer. One of the reasons this myth developed is that these devices emit radiofrequency radiation (radio waves), a form of non-ionizing radiation. The<br>body absorbs
                                    this radiation.<br><br>Scientists know that exposure to ionizing radiation, for instance, X-rays, increases the risk of cancer. However, radiofrequency radiation is&nbsp;<em>non</em>-ionizing radiation, which does not
                                    increase cancer risk. The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/radiation/cell-phones-fact-sheet">National Cancer Institute</a>&nbsp;writes:<br><br>“[A]lthough many studies have examined
                                    the potential health effects of non-ionizing radiation from radar, microwave ovens, cell phones, and other sources, there is currently no consistent evidence that non-ionizing radiation increases cancer risk in humans.”<br><br><strong>4. Power lines cause cancer</strong><br><br>This
                                    is also a myth. The extremely low frequency (ELF) magnetic fields produced by power lines are non-ionizing and, therefore, do not cause cancer.<br><br>The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/cancer-causes/radiation-exposure/extremely-low-frequency-radiation.html">American Cancer Society</a>&nbsp;writes:<br><br><strong>“Several large studies have looked at the possible&nbsp;effects of ELF magnetic fields on cancer in rats and mice. These studies expose&nbsp;the animals to magnetic fields much stronger than what people are normally&nbsp;exposed to at home […]. Most of these studies have found no increase in the&nbsp;risk of any type of cancer. In fact, the risk of some types of cancer was&nbsp;actually lower in the animals exposed to the ELF radiation.”</strong><br><br>However,
                                    the American Cancer Society also explains that some studies have found a slight increase in leukemia risk for children who live close to power lines. However, the reasons for this remain unclear.<br><br><em>Medical News Today</em>&nbsp;spoke
                                    with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bloodspecialist.co.uk/about.html">Dr. Joel</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bloodspecialist.co.uk/about.html">Newman</a>, a consultant hematologist and specialty lead for pathology at East
                                    Sussex Healthcare Trust in the U.K. He puts the risk into perspective:<br><br><strong>“We don’t have any real evidence that cell phones or&nbsp;power lines cause cancer, and there are many other things that we do daily that&nbsp;put us at a much greater risk than these ever could, including smoking and&nbsp;alcohol consumption.”</strong><br><br><strong>5. Artificial sweeteners cause cancer</strong><br><br>To
                                    date, there is&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/diet/artificial-sweeteners-fact-sheet">no good evidence</a>&nbsp;that artificial sweeteners increase the risk of developing cancer.<br><br>The
                                    National Cancer Institute explains why this myth may have arisen:<br><br><strong>“Questions about artificial sweeteners and cancer&nbsp;arose when early studies showed that cyclamate in combination with saccharin&nbsp;caused bladder cancer in laboratory animals.”</strong><br><br>However,
                                    they explain that further studies “have not provided clear evidence of an association with cancer in humans. Similarly, studies of other [Food and Drug Administration (FDA)]-approved sweeteners have not demonstrated
                                    clear evidence of an association with cancer in humans.”<br><br>Similarly, a&nbsp;<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16985027/">studyTrusted</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16985027/">Source</a>&nbsp;investigating
                                    aspartame and cancer, which included data from more than half a million participants, found no links between “aspartame consumption and lymphoma, leukemia, or brain cancer.”<br><br><strong>6. Cancer surgery causes cancer to spread</strong><br><br>This
                                    is only a partial myth. It&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;true that cancer surgery can cause the cancer to spread, but this is rare. As<br>the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cancer.org/treatment/treatments-and-side-effects/treatment-types/surgery/risks-of-cancer-surgery.html">American Cancer Society</a>&nbsp;explains:<br><br><strong>“Advances in equipment used during surgery and more&nbsp;detailed imaging tests have helped make this risk very low.”</strong><br><br>A
                                    related&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3724400/">mythTrusted</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3724400/">Source</a>&nbsp;indicates that a tumor will grow faster
                                    or spread to other parts of the body when exposed to the air. This is untrue.<br><br><br><strong>7. Herbal medicines can cure cancer</strong><br><br>There is no evidence that any herbal medicines can cure or treat cancer.<br><br>However,
                                    some people find certain alternative therapies, such as acupuncture, meditation, and yoga,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/cam">help</a>&nbsp;with the psychological stress associated with
                                    cancer and some of the side effects of cancer treatment.<br><br>As the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/cam">National</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/cam">Cancer Institute</a>&nbsp;points
                                    out, just because something is “natural” does not mean it is safe. In some circumstances, herbal supplements can harm a person’s health; they provide a couple of examples:<br><br>“[S]ome studies have shown that kava
                                    kava, a herb that some people use to help with stress and anxiety, may cause liver damage. And St. John’s wort, which some people use for depression, may cause certain cancer drugs not to work as well as they should.”<br><br>It
                                    is important that people with cancer speak with a doctor about supplements and vitamins before taking them.<br><br><strong>8. Cancer runs in families</strong><br><br>Although some cancers are passed on genetically through
                                    families, they are the minority of cases: an estimated&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/causes-of-cancer/inherited-cancer-genes-and-increased-cancer-risk/family-history-and-inherited-cancer-genes">3–10%</a>&nbsp;of
                                    cancers result from mutations inherited from parents.<br><br>Because people are more likely to develop cancer as they age, and people today live longer lives, it is not uncommon for people to have some relatives who
                                    develop cancer. This might help explain why this myth persists.<br><br>Most cases of cancer are due to a buildup of mutations in genes that accumulate over time. As the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/cancer-causes/genetics.html">American</a>&nbsp;
                                    <a
                                        href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/cancer-causes/genetics.html">Cancer Society</a>&nbsp;explains:<br><br><strong>“Some types of cancer run in certain families, but&nbsp;most cancers are not clearly linked to the genes we inherit from our parents.&nbsp;Gene changes that start in a single cell over the course of a person’s life&nbsp;cause most cancers.”</strong><br><br><strong>9. Cancer always comes back</strong><br><br>To
                                        address this question,&nbsp;<em>MNT</em>&nbsp;spoke with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.memorialcare.org/providers/collin-c-vu">Dr. Collin Vu</a>, a medical oncologist and hematologist at MemorialCare Cancer Institute
                                        at Orange Coast Medical Center in Fountain Valley, CA. He said:<br><br><strong>“Fortunately for all of us, this statement is a myth&nbsp;and entirely not true. The current therapies for cancers are improving to the&nbsp;point where the cure of cancer — that is, treatments that will kill cancer</strong><br><strong>completely — are improving continuously.”</strong><br><br>However,
                                        he explains that the subject is complicated because “different cancer types have a markedly different ability to be cured, and different cancer types also have different time frames for which a cancer may typically
                                        recur. [This] makes it very difficult for patients to know when they may be truly ‘cured’ or when they still have a high risk of cancer recurrence.”<br><br>Dr. Vu has great hopes for the future of cancer treatment;
                                        he told&nbsp;<em>MNT</em>:<br><br>“In the future, with current scientific progress in better treatments for cancer, and improved population awareness of cancer risks and diagnosis, the statement that ‘cancer always
                                        comes back’ may become even more of a myth.”<br><br><strong>10. There is no cure for cancer</strong><br><br>Thankfully, this is also a myth. As medical science delves deeper into the mechanisms behind cancer, treatments
                                        steadily grow more effective.<br><br>According to Dr. Vu, some cancers, such as testicular and thyroid cancer, have a&nbsp;<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31436897/">60%Trusted</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31436897/">Source</a>&nbsp;cure
                                        rate. Dr. Vu defines the cure rate as “the population of cancer patients that has the same life expectancy as the general population.”<br><br>Breast, prostate, and bladder also have cure rates of around 50%. Dr.
                                        Vu concludes:<br><br>“As can be seen by the above data, some cancers can be eradicated, but, unfortunately, not all cancers can be cured completely. There is ongoing optimism that cure rates are increasing given
                                        the ongoing focus on screening and better treatments for cancer.”<br><br><em>MNT</em>&nbsp;also spoke with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.providence.org/doctors/profile/200233-anton-joel-bilchik">Dr. Anton Bilchik, Ph.D.</a>,
                                        a surgical oncologist, professor of surgery, chief of gastrointestinal research, and chief of medicine at Saint John’s Cancer Institute at Providence Saint John’s Health Center in Santa Monica, CA. He also leads
                                        with a message of hope:<br><br>“It is imperative that patients who are diagnosed with cancer, even at an advanced stage, do not lose hope: there are many effective, novel therapies, as well as more effective surgical
                                        techniques. A good example is with the use of modern immunotherapy, up to 40% of patients with stage 4 melanoma are curable, and 50% of patients with stage 4 colon cancer metastati to the liver can be cured with
                                        a combination of chemotherapy and surgery.”<br><br>In short: although the battle with cancer is ongoing, science is making significant headway.<br><br></p>
